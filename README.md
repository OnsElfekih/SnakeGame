# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java using `Swing`. The game is played on a grid, where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow in length. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edges of the board.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- **Random Food Placement**: Each time the snake eats food, it grows, and new food is placed randomly on the board.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the board's boundary or collides with its own body.
- **Score Display**: The score is shown on the board, indicating how many pieces of food the snake has eaten.
